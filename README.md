Update(01/12/2022):

1. Manually download Orphan drug data from U.S. FDA site (<a href='https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/opdlisting/oopd/'>Data Source </a>)
2. Mnaually download MetamapLite NIH site (< a href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/MetaMap/run-locally/MetaMapLite.html"> Text Parsing Tool</a>)
3. Change 'MetaMap_path' and 'Source_file' in the main program (process_fda_file.py) based on the tool location 
4. Run the program (with or without record row id) to produce output files (new_df2.xlsx, fda_disease.json and fda_drug.json)
5. Manually review the final output file (new_df2.xlsx) to adjust any wrong parsing content and reprodce json files if necessary
6. Rename *.json into data.json based on different plugin and move it to upper folder
